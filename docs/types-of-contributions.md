# Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to AFFiNE in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on AFFiNE!

### :mega: Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/discussions).

### :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:
You can [create a new pull request](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/compare) and view [current pull requests](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/pulls).

### :question: Support

We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product.
You may be able to find additional help and information on our social media platforms and groups - the links to these can be found in our [README](../README.md).

### :earth_asia: Translations

AFFiNE is internationalized and available in multiple languages. The source content in this repository is written in English. We integrate with an external localization platform to work with the community in localizing the English content. You can find more info on our community page, in our [i18n General Space ](https://community.affine.pro/c/i18n-general).
