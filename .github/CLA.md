# AFFiNE Contributor License Agreement

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, AFFiNE must have on file a signed Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") from each contributor, indicating agreement with the license terms below. This agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the AFFiNE and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your past, present and future contributions submitted to AFFiNE. You should sign this agreement before submitting your first contribution. Except for the license granted herein to AFFiNE and recipients of software distributed by AFFiNE, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Parties.

   (a) "AFFiNE" refers to the project's operator, TOEVERYTHING PTE. LTD registered in Republic of Singapore.

   (b) "You" (or "Your") means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with AFFiNE.

2. Definitions. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to AFFiNE for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by AFFiNE (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to AFFiNE or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, AFFiNE for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution".

3. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to AFFiNE and to recipients of software distributed by AFFiNE a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, copy, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute, sublicense, and publicly perform and display the Contribution and such derivative works on any licensing terms, including without limitation open source licenses and binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses.

5. Except as set out above, You keep all right, title, and interest in your contribution. The rights that you grant to AFFiNE under these terms are effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to AFFiNE, even if your submission took place before the date you sign these terms.

7. You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
