## Join our community

Before we tell you how to get started with AFFiNE, we'd like to shamelessly plug our awesome user and developer communities across [official social platforms](https://docs.affine.pro/affine/community-links/official-communities)! Once you’re familiar with using the software, maybe you will share your wisdom with others and even consider joining the [AFFiNE Ambassador program](https://docs.affine.pro/affine/affine-ambassadors/welcome) to help spread AFFiNE to the world.

## Features

**Privacy focussed** — AFFiNE is built with your privacy in mind and is one of our key concerns. We want you to keep control of your data, allowing you to store it as you like, where you like while still being able to freely edit and view your data on-demand.

**Offline-first** - With your privacy in mind we also decided to go offline-first. This means that AFFiNE can be used offline, whether you want to view or edit, with support for conflict-free merging when you are back online.

**Clean, intuitive design** — With AFFiNE you can concentrate on editing with a clean and modern interface. Which is responsive, so it looks great on tablets too, and mobile support is coming in the future.

**Seamless transtions** — However you want your data displayed, whichever viewing mode you use, AFFiNE supports easy transitions to allow you to quickly and effortlessly view your data in the way you want.

**Markdown support** — When you write in AFFiNE you can use Markdown syntax which helps create an easier editing experience, that can be experienced with just a keyboard. And this allows you to export your data cleanly into Markdown.
<!--
**Colloboration** — Whether you want to colloborate with yourself across multiple devices, or work together with others, support for colloboration and multiplayer is out-of-the-box, which makes it easy for teams to get started with AFFiNE.
-->
**Choice of multiple languages** — Thanks to community contributions AFFiNE offers support for multiple languages. If you don't find your language or would like to suggest some changes we welcome your contributions.

## Getting started

⚠️ Please note that AFFiNE is still under active development and is not yet ready for production use. ⚠️

## Thanks

We would also like to give thanks to open-source projects that make AFFiNE possible:

-   [BlockSuite](https://github.com/toeverything/BlockSuite) - AFFiNE is built with and powered by BlockSuite.
-   [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) & [Yrs](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-crdt) -- Fundamental support of CRDTs for our implementation on state management and data sync.
-   [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) -- View layer support and web GUI framework.
-   [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) -- High performance language that extends the ability and availability of our real-time backend, JWST.
-   [Fossil](https://www2.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki) -- Source code management tool made with CRDTs which inspired our design on block data structure.
-   [slatejs](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate) -- Customizable rich-text editor.
-   [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) -- Minimal state management tool for frontend.

We use the following open source projects to help us build a better development experience:

-   [nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx) -- Awesome monorepo manager & build system
-   [tolgee](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform) -- Elegant i18n collaborative editing platform

Thanks a lot to the community for providing such powerful and simple libraries, so that we can focus more on the implementation of the product logic, and we hope that in the future our projects will also provide a more easy-to-use knowledge base for everyone.
